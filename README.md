Riseup Help Pages
==================================

This is the repository for the riseup help pages at http://help.riseup.net.

It is entirely static, but relies on a bunch of apache tricks for things like
language negotiation. Riseup help uses a static website generator called `amber`
to render the source files into html files.

To submit changes, please fork this repo and issue pull requests on github. If
you don't know how to use git, you can submit changes via the github website
(see "Editing on github" below for instructions).

Simple method - editing on github
--------------------------------------------

Learning to use git can be very difficult. As an alternative, it is possible
to contribute to riseup_help by directly editing pages through the github
website. This method does not let you preview how the page will render, but it
does allow you to contribute edits without needing to install any software.

First, you need to register a github.com account. Then visit
https://github.com/riseupnet/riseup_help

To edit files:

* **Existing Files:** You can edit an existing file by clicking on the file
  name and then clicking the "Edit" button in the file's toolbar (it looks like
  pencil). To save, type a commit message and hit the "Propose file change" button.
* **New Files:** You can add a new page by clicking the "+" button at the
  end of the path breadcrumbs (e.g. "riseup_help / pages / chat / [+]"
  near the top of the page). When you are done editing the content, hit the
  "Propose new file" button.

Boom, you are done. one of the riseup birds will review the change request
and either merge it right away or add comments.

Advanced method - using git and amber
--------------------------------------------

Installing amber

In order to preview your edits to the content in `pages` you will need a
program called `amber`.

To install on Debian or Ubuntu (Wheezy or later):

    sudo apt-get install ruby ruby-dev build-essential zlib1g-dev
    sudo gem install amber

To install on Mac, see below. Check https://github.com/elijh/amber for more
information.

Previewing pages

After you have made changes, run this command in the riseup_help directory to
completely re-render the entire site (takes a long time):

    amber rebuild

When you are making changes, it is easiest to see a preview of these changes
by running the amber server:

    amber server

Then browse to http://localhost:8000. Any page you view this way gets re-
rendered when it is loaded.

Putting it all together:

1. Go to https://github.com/riseupnet/riseup_help and click the fork button.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone ssh://git@github.com/your-id/riseup_help`
3. Start the amber server: `cd riseup_help; amber server`
4. Edit files in `riseup_help/pages`
5. Preview changes in your browser using http://localhost:8000
6. When satisfied, `git commit`, `git push`
7. Go to https://github.com/your-id/riseup_help and [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)

One way you can refresh your repo with upstream before pushing:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/riseupnet/riseup_help
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/master

You only need to run `git remote add` once. Alternately, you could set origin to be `riseupnet/riseup_help` and add your fork as a remote.

Directories
--------------------------------------------

    riseup_help/
      amber/     -- amber configuration, stylesheets, layouts, etc.
      disabled/  -- draft pages or pages that are disabled.
      notes/     -- notes and todos.
      pages/     -- the source text for the website pages.
      public/    -- the rendered output (not committed to git).

The static content files in `riseup_help/public` are rendered from the content in
`riseup_help/pages`. You edit pages in the `pages` directory, but never edit
anything in the `public` directory.

Amber file structure
--------------------------------------------

There are two ways to create pages:

A page might be represented by files with different language suffixes:

    email.en.text
    email.pt.text

Alternately, a page might be represented by a folder. This method allows you
to have sub-pages

    email/
      en.text
      pt.text
      client/
        en.text

In general, it is preferred to use the folder method.

Modifying Navigation
--------------------------------------------

If you need to add or remove a top or side nav menu, you'll need to edit

    amber/menu.txt

Note that you will need to restart the amber server for changes to take effect.

Notes on markup
--------------------------------------------

You can create pages in three different markup languages:

* textile (suffix .text)
* markdown (suffix .md)
* haml (suffix .haml)

Most of the riseup help pages are written using textile. It is best to keep to
textile for consistency.

Here is a brief overview of textile markup:

    h1. heading 1
    h2. heading 2

    this is a paragraph

    * this is a list
    * another item in the list

    "this is a link":http://to-this-url.org

    here is some *bold text*

For a complete reference, see http://redcloth.org/textile/

Amber adds an additional way to make links:

    [[label -> page-name]]
    or
    [[page-name]]
    or
    [[chat/client]]

By using this double bracket link notation will automatically find the right
path for the page with the specified name. Also, it will warn you if the page
name is missing and it will ensure that the link is created with the correct
language prefix. In haml, you can get the same effect using
`link 'label' => 'page'`

The standard textile method of linking does not work well with non-latin
languages, so it is recommended that you always use the amber method of
forming links.

Setting page properties
--------------------------------------------

Every file can have a "properties header". It looks like this:

    @title = "A fine page"
    @toc = false

    continue on here with body text.

The properties start with '@' and are stripped out of the source file before
it is rendered. Property header lines are evaluated as ruby. All properties
are optional and they are inherited, including `@title`. To make a property
not get inherited, use `@this.propertyname = 'value'` instead.

Available properties:

* `@title` -- The title for the page, appearing as in an H1 on the top of the
   page and as the HTML title. Also used for navigation title if `@nav_title`
   is not set.
* `@nav_title` -- The title for the navigation to this page, as well as the
   HTML title if @title is not set.
* `@summary` -- Displayed under the title.
* `@toc` -- If set to `false`, don't include a table of contents when rendering
   the file. This only applies to .text and .md files.
* `@layout` -- Manually set the layout template to use for rendering this page.
* `@this.alias` -- An alternate url path (or paths if the value is an array)
   where this page should be available.

Translating
--------------------------------------------

For the most part, to create a new translation for a given page, copy en.text
file to xx.text and edit the document (where xx is the language code of language
you are translating into).

The language codes are as follows:

* zh: Simplified Chinese
* es: Spanish
* en: English
* pt: Portuguese
* ru: Russian
* de: German
* fr: French
* it: Italian
* el: Greek
* ca: Catalan

Only those languages are currently enabled. We are happy to add additional
languages if there is sufficient interest.

In addition to the text of a particular page, the navigation items and footer
text can be found in `amber/locales/xx.yml`.

When translating the text of a page you should only modify the label of the
links but not the page names that the links point to. For example:

    [[Security => security]]

Should be translated to:

    [[Seguridad => security]]

The locale will be automatically added to the link, so there is no need to ever
include it (e.g. the link `[[Seguridad => security]]` will link to
https://help.riseup.net/es/security). The link `[[Security => security]]` could
have also been written simply `[[Security]]`.

We do not yet have the capability to automatically identify which translated
pages need to be updated. However, in the future, I plan to add the command
`amber diff [language-code]`, which will automatically spit out a listing that
shows the changes made to the source English pages since the translation for
each page was made.

Installing on Mac
--------------------------------------------

(I haven't tried this myself)

Ruby 1.9 or greater is required to run amber.

Mac OS 10.9 (Mavericks) or later is running ruby 2.0 and can work with amber
out of the box. For earlier Mac OS releases, you need to upgrade the ruby that
comes with the computer. The easiest way to do this is with homebrew. To
install, open a terminal and type:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
    brew install ruby

After ruby is at 1.9 or newer, then just run:

    sudo gem install amber

Alternately, if you want different versions of ruby installed, consider:

Windows is not yet supported.
